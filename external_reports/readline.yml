          This depends on what was already present on the system. We
          don't know how to look at that yet.

    description: >
      The _rl_tropen function in util.c in GNU readline before 6.3 patch
      3 allows local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a
      symlink attack on a /var/tmp/rltrace.[PID] file.
    comments: >
      The presence of affected versions of Term-ReadLine-Gnu suggests
      that a vulnerable version of the readline linrary is installed on
      the host system.
