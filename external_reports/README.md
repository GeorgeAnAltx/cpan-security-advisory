# Vulnerabilities in distributed, third-party libraries

Some Perl modules distribute third-party libraries, such as
jQuery or libgit2. The reports in this directory collect that
information.

The *util/invert-third-party.pl* program then turns them into reports
in the same format as the stuff under *cpansa/*, which CPAN::Audit can
then use to build its database.

See the *util/invert-third-party.pl* program for details on the
particular file format. It's a bit loosey-goosey based on whatever
is needed at the time.
