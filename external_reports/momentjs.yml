    description: >
      Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating,
      manipulating, and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability
      impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and
      2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly
      used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2,
      and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a
      workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing
      it to Moment.js.
