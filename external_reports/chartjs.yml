advisories:
  - cve: CVE-2020-7746
    description: >
      This affects the package chart.js before 2.9.4. The options
      parameter is not properly sanitized when it is processed. When the
      options are processed, the existing options (or the defaults options)
      are deeply merged with provided options. However, during this
      operation, the keys of the object being set are not checked, leading
      to a prototype pollution.
    affected_versions: "<2.9.4"
    fixed_versions: ">=2.9.4"
