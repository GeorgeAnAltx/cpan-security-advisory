  distribution: Crypt-Passwd-XS
  reported: 2012-05-07
  description: >
    The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function does not process the
    complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80
    character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers
    to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial
    substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode
    password.
