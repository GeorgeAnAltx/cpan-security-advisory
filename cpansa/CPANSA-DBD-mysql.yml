  description: >
    The DBD::mysql module through 4.043 for Perl allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free
    and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering (1) certain error responses from
    a MySQL server or (2) a loss of a network connection to a MySQL server. The use-after-free defect was introduced by
    relying on incorrect Oracle mysql_stmt_close documentation and code examples.

  description: >
    The DBD::mysql module through 4.043 for Perl uses the mysql_ssl=1 setting to mean that SSL is optional (even though
    this setting's documentation has a "your communication with the server will be encrypted" statement), which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a cleartext-downgrade attack, a related issue to CVE-2015-3152.
