  description: >
      perl-archive-zip is vulnerable to a directory traversal in Archive::Zip. It was found that the Archive::Zip module
      did not properly sanitize paths while extracting zip files. An attacker able to provide a specially crafted
      archive for processing could use this flaw to write or overwrite arbitrary files in the context of the perl
      interpreter.
