    The path as passed in the fragment request data structure was used
    verbatim in the dispatcher and other locations.  This possibly
    allowed requests to walk around ACLs by requesting
    '/some/safe/place/../../../dangerous' as a fragment.

    Jifty did not protect users against a class of remote data access
    vulnerability. If an attacker knew the structure of your local
    filesystem and you were using the "standalone" webserver in
    production, the attacker could gain read only access to local
    files.
