- id: CPANSA-SOAP-Lite-2015-01
  distribution: SOAP-Lite
  reported: 2015-07-21
  description: >
    An example attack consists of defining 10 or more XML entities,
    each defined as consisting of 10 of the previous entity, with the
    document consisting of a single instance of the largest entity,
    which expands to one billion copies of the first entity. The
    amount of computer memory used for handling an external SOAP call
    would likely exceed that available to the process parsing the XML.
