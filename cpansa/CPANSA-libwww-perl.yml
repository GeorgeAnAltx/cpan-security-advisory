    The Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in
    WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running
    in environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header,
    does not enable full validation of SSL certificates by default,
    which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving hostnames that are not
    properly validated.

    lwp-download in libwww-perl before 5.835 does not reject downloads
    to filenames that begin with a . (dot) character, which allows
    remote servers to create or overwrite files via (1) a 3xx redirect
    to a URL with a crafted filename or (2) a Content-Disposition
    header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute
    arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home
    directory.

    If LWP::UserAgent::env_proxy is called in a CGI environment, the
    case-insensitivity when looking for "http_proxy" permits
    "HTTP_PROXY" to be found, but this can be trivially set by the web
    client using the "Proxy:" header.
