  description: >
    The Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple module before 0.34 for Perl
    allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files if there is a '.'
    character anywhere in the pathname, which differs from the
    intended policy of allowing access only when the filename itself
    has a '.' character.
