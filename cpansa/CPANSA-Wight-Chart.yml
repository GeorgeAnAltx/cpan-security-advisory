    - CVE-2020-7746
  description: >
    This affects the package chart.js before 2.9.4. The options
    parameter is not properly sanitized when it is processed. When the
    options are processed, the existing options (or the defaults options)
    are deeply merged with provided options. However, during this
    operation, the keys of the object being set are not checked, leading
    to a prototype pollution.
