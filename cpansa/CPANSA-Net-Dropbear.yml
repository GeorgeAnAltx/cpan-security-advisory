    - CVE-2019-17362
  description: >
    In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function
    (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain
    invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or
    read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted
    DER-encoded data.
