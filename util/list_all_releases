	% perl list_all_releases Some::Module Other::Module

This script gets the download URLs for all releases for the modules
you specify. I use this to then download all releases so I can look
at the history of development.

This script is simply a modulino that uses L<Local::Tools::list_all_releases>
in this distribution. See that module for more information.
